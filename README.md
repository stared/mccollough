# McCollough effect with different shapes

Vide my [Dreams, drugs & ConvNets](https://medium.com/@pmigdal/dreams-drugs-convnets-ae7ed6ad50a5) and [Exploring human vs machine learning (one blogpost at a time)](https://p.migdal.pl/2019/07/15/human-machine-learning-motivation.html) for a wider context. I am interested in retraining low-lever layers in our OWN neural networks. It is curious, and may shine light on how biological neural networks learn.

* [McCollough effect - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect)
* [McCollough fffect](https://michaelbach.de/ot/col-McCollough/index.html) - the current one I suggest for using
* [McCollough Effect - The Illusion Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/ir/mccollough-effect) - an overview with numerous references

I create this one to try different patterns that horizontal and vertical bars.

## Project setup

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```

First, install [push-dir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/push-dir). Then:

```
npm run build; push-dir --dir=dist --branch=gh-pages --cleanup
```

See [Deploy Vue to GitHub pages-the easy way!](https://medium.com/@codetheorist/vue-up-your-github-pages-the-right-way-955486220418). You need to set relative paths in `vue.config.js`.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
